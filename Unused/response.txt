Based on the provided video chunks data, it appears that the limitation of KNN is discussed in two different videos. 

The first part where KNN's limitations are talked about (although not explicitly stated) is in Video 6 at start time: 837.12 seconds and end time: 839.12 seconds. At this point, there seems to be some confusion with the video content; however, we can't find any information on what is being discussed.

However, when discussing KNN more directly in Video 6 at start time: 843.12 seconds and end time: 845.12 seconds, it is stated that "So, what will be the limitation of KNN?" This part of the video appears to delve deeper into a specific aspect of the limitations of the algorithm.

For learning where exactly this part occurs, please look for Video 6 at start time: 843.12 seconds and end time: 845.12 seconds.
